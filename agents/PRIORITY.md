# forge (lukebmay) — active priorities

**Updated:** 2026-08-10  
**Lens:** healthy codebase first — ownership, pure reuse, unit tests. Size is a symptom.  
**Branch:** **`master`** default  
**Push:** only when human asks.

**Active:** **R015 empty-mon DnD** shipped (L0 green); host Wayland needs tip load
(nest retest or one logout). Lifecycle residual optional.  
Architecture = cold spine + D019 hard/soft (not patch thrash).

**FIRM:** Prefer `forge nested run -- …` (auto stop). Interactive nest → `stop` when done.  
Never leave subshells running. Default mon=1. See [testing.md](./testing.md) + [HANDOFF](./HANDOFF.md).

## Queue

| Pri | Item | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **next** | Host load tip for R015 (nest dual-mon smoke or logout once); operator confirm empty-mon drag | [REGRESSIONS R015](./REGRESSIONS.md) |
| optional | Per-window signals → WindowAttach | [plan](./plans/forge-lifecycle-abstractions.md) |
| later | STACKED / resize-autotile | separate plans — do not mix into settle spine |
| abandoned | `Ctrl+Super+Esc` unfocus (FC2) | keybind unbound |
| done | **R015** empty-mon drag snap-back | L0 `bug-r015-empty-mon-dnd`; live `L1.r015-empty-mon-dnd` |
| done | Wayland RC **R013/R014** + host logout + suite | [completed](./plans/forge-wayland-rc-test-suite/completed/forge-wayland-rc_r013-r014.md) |
| done | Nest isolation **N3→N1→N4→N2** (D022 v1) | [plan](./plans/forge-nested-isolation.md) · [completed/](./plans/forge-nested-isolation/completed/) |
| done | Nest isolation **D0 design lock** | [completed](./tasks/completed/forge-nested-isolation_d0-discussion.md) |
| done | Pure bags + **W1–W5** + **L8/L11**; **R011/R012**; D019; CLI jobs | [completed/](./plans/forge-lifecycle-abstractions/completed/) · [REGRESSIONS](./REGRESSIONS.md) |

### Why this order

1. **R015** was daily-driver (empty mon drag snap-back) — queue was empty of hard P1.  
2. Host Shell on Wayland cannot HUP — load tip via nest retest (dual mon) or one logout.  
3. Optional lifecycle residual only after operator can use cross-mon drag.

**Do not** start dual-mon nest by default. **Do not** nest for no-code host smokes.

**Handoff:** [HANDOFF.md](./HANDOFF.md).

```bash
forge nested run -- true    # campaign entry; always stops
forge nested status         # running: False
# After R015 JS install (dual-mon behavior under test):
./install && forge nested run --monitors=2 -- forge test live plan --tags R015
```
