# Contributing to Forge

Thanks for helping out! This is the [lukebmay/forge](https://github.com/lukebmay/forge)
product tree, based on the community [jcrussell/forge](https://github.com/jcrussell/forge)
fork of upstream [Forge](https://github.com/forge-ext/forge).

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** and **gettext**
- A GNOME Shell 45+ session for manual testing (X11 or Wayland)

## Set up & build

```bash
npm install        # dependencies + git hooks

make dev           # compile schemas + install to ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/
make prod          # like dev, then enable + restart shell
```

Apply changes: on X11, `Alt+F2` → `r` → Enter (or `killall -HUP gnome-shell`); on
Wayland, log out/in — or use a **nested** Shell that you can restart without
logging out of the host session:

```bash
# Preferred (durable bus + Forge enable; restartable) — host must be Wayland
# Dev CLI (not user forge): ./scripts/forge/forge-test
make nested-start          # or: ./scripts/forge/forge-test nested start
eval $(./scripts/forge/forge-test nested env --export)
forge ping
make nested-restart        # reload extension JS after rebuild/install
make nested-stop
./scripts/forge/forge-test nested doctor   # can_nested? (exits 2 on X11)

# On X11: do not use nested — killall -HUP gnome-shell / make test-x
# Legacy foreground nest (blocks the terminal; no private state dir)
make test                  # build + install + foreground nested Shell
make test-x                # build + restart gnome-shell (X11)
make log                   # tail Forge's logs
```

## Tests

```bash
npm test                 # unit tests (Vitest, mocked GNOME APIs)
make unit-test-docker    # the same, in the canonical Docker environment
make e2e-test            # end-to-end tests against real GNOME Shell in Docker
```

- Unit-test guide (fixtures, mocks, avoiding vacuous tests):
  [tests/README.md](tests/README.md).
- E2E infrastructure: [tests/e2e/README.md](tests/e2e/README.md).

New behavior should come with a test. Unit tests must drive real `lib/` code, not
reimplement it — a test that can't go red when you break the code under test isn't
testing anything.

## Code style

- **Prettier**, 2-space indent, 100-char width. Run `npm run format`; `npm run lint`
  checks. A pre-commit hook formats staged files and runs the related unit tests, so
  commits are gated automatically.
- Match the surrounding code's naming and idioms.
- Core classes are `GObject`s registered with the
  `static { GObject.registerClass(this); }` pattern; track signal IDs and disconnect
  them on teardown (see [docs/dev/architecture.md](docs/dev/architecture.md)).

## Understanding the codebase

Start with [docs/dev/](docs/dev/): architecture (lifecycle, tree model, dispatch,
signal discipline), rendering (the placement pipeline), and compat (Mutter version
shims). The user-facing behavior is documented in [docs/user/](docs/user/).

## Translations

User-facing strings are wrapped in `_("...")` and localized with gettext. When you
add or change a string, run `make update-pot` and commit `po/forge.pot`. Catalogs
(`po/<lang>.po`) are currently maintained manually via `make update-po`; crowd-sourced
translation through Weblate is planned but not yet active (pending upstreaming).
Full workflow: [docs/dev/translations.md](docs/dev/translations.md).

## Submitting changes

1. Branch off `master` (this fork’s default; upstream community repos use `main`).
2. Make the change with a test; run `npm test` and `npm run lint`.
3. Open a PR with a clear description of the problem and the fix.

GNOME compatibility matters: changes should work on GNOME 45+ across X11 and
Wayland. Mutter API differences belong in `lib/extension/compat.js`
([docs/dev/compat.md](docs/dev/compat.md)), not scattered through the codebase.

## Releasing

Maintainers: cutting a release and submitting to extensions.gnome.org is
documented in [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md).
