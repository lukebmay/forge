 * forge-5y6j: the settings "changed" handler connected in _bindSignals was the
 * only signal connection whose ID was never stored, so _removeSignals could not
 * disconnect it. After disable() the stale handler kept firing on dconf changes
 * (the old Gio.Settings stays rooted via Logger's static field) and crashed
 * into the nulled extension (`this.ext.settings is null`) on a zombie
 * WindowManager.
 *
 * Fix: own the connect on the WM SignalBag (group "settings") and
 * disconnectAll in _removeSignals.
