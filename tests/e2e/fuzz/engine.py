"""Fuzz engine: drive steps, settle, check invariants, persist repros (forge-cnrc).

The engine is deliberately stateless w.r.t. randomness — it only *executes* concrete
steps (from actions.generate_step or a saved repro). This is what lets run_session and
replay share one execution path, so a replayed step list does the same thing the
original session did.

Oracle bundle, run after every step (post a forced synchronous render):
  1. liveness  — eval("1"); a throw means the shell died (fatal, not a tree bug).
  2. structure+geometry — bridge.fuzz_check_invariants (the SOUND rule set).
  3. log scan  — new JS ERROR / finalized-object lines on the live gnome-shell log.

A re-readable structure/geometry violation is re-checked once after an extra settle before
it is declared real, to absorb the rare transient (e.g. a chaos step read a hair early).
One-shot findings (log errors, dead/unresponsive shell) are AUTHORITATIVE on first sight and
returned immediately — re-running the oracle would scan past the matched log line (its offset
already advanced) or fail to re-eval a dead shell, losing the finding (B1).
