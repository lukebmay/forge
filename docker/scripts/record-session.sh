#!/bin/bash
# Screencast start/stop wrapper for the Forge E2E suite (forge-qgg).
#
# Launches/stops the long-lived recorder (record-monitor.py) that holds a single
# D-Bus session connection open for the whole pytest run. See record-monitor.py
# for why a one-shot `gdbus call` cannot work (NameOwnerChanged auto-stop).
#
# Usage:
#   record-session.sh start <workpath.webm>     # begin recording
#   record-session.sh stop   [<dest.webm>]      # stop; optionally copy to dest
#
# Idempotent: stop with no live recorder (or called twice) is a clean no-op.
